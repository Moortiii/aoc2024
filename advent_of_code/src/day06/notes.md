Bruteforce solutions:

- Add an obstacle at every square and check if the same square has been visted N number of times (i.e. 10 000)
- Add an obstacle at every square and note down the path taken. Look for a repeated path, i.e. [(0,1), (0,2), ... (0,1), (0,2), ... (0,1, 02)]

We don't actually need to know _where_ to place the obstacles, just how many. Run each square for N iterations and check if the guard ever leaves the map?
